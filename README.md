# Digit Recognition using CNN

A complete deep learning project that recognizes handwritten digits using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
Built with **PyTorch**, this project includes a **custom GUI app using Tkinter** that lets users draw digits and get real-time predictions.

### 🔍 Overview

This project uses the **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits to train a CNN model.  
The trained model achieves over **99% accuracy** and is integrated into a simple desktop GUI where you can draw digits and see instant predictions.
